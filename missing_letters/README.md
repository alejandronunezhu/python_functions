# Missing Letters 🅰️🅱️

This is a simple Python program that returns the letters missing from the English alphabet in a given input string.

## How it works

The program asks the user to input a string and it then returns all the letters from the alphabet that are missing
in the string.


## Example
- INPUT:  'abcd'
- OUTPUT: 'efg...z'
