# Tip Calculator üí∏üçΩÔ∏è

This is a simple Python program that helps calculate the tip amount based on the cost of a meal and the desired tip percentage.

## How it Works

The program:

1. Asks the user how much the meal cost (e.g., `$50.00`)
2. Asks what percentage they‚Äôd like to tip (e.g., `15%`)
3. Calculates the tip amount
4. Prints the amount of tip to leave, formatted to two decimal places

## Example

- How much was the meal? $50.00
- What percentage would you like to tip? 20%
- OUTPUT: $10.00
